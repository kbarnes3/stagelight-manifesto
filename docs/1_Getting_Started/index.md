Getting Started
===============
{{ site.name }} is broken down into phases. After each phase, it's possible to validate or show off what you've
done so far. Phase one is focused on getting your lights connected to your Raspberry Pi and cycling through test patterns.
Unfortunately, the first phase also requires the most purchasing and a fair amount of soldering. This phase will walk you
through picking out the right components, installing all the software, and hooking everything up, first on a breadboard
and then on a soldered circuit board.

# Purchase list
For purchases, this guide will try to provide direct links to items as well as what features are important if you want
to look for different items to better meet your needs. Due to the focused nature of this project, the required specs will
be pretty rigid. Some items are only used in breadboarding; they can be omitted if you prefer to skip these steps.

1. [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.adafruit.com/products/3055) -
If you have a Raspberry Pi 2 sitting around, it should also work but it isn't yet tested completely. Due to the software
distribution used, only Raspberry Pi's are supported and tested. There are many bundles available online that contain
a Pi as well as many of the below items, as well as many items not needed for {{ site.name }}.
Some of these bundles might be cost effective for you.

1. Micro SD Card -
{{ stie.name }} doesn't have very demanding requirements for its SD card, beyond the 
[requirements for a Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md).
Any card with that meets these requirements and is at least 4 GB in capacity will be fine.
