Stagelight Manifesto
====================

**Stagelight Manifesto is not complete yet. Please check back later!**

Stagelight Manifesto is an ambient lighting system for TVs or other screens with HDMI input.
While many similar implementations exist, Stagelight Manifesto aims to provide end-to-end directions for creating
an ambient lighting setup.

Specifically, 'Stagelight Manifesto' is a set of documentation and scripts focusing on allowing more people to
create ambient lighting in a repeatable way. Features of Stagelight Manifesto are:

1. A list of all components, with links to specific components and what to look for if you want to make a substitution.
1. Step by step directions for setting everything up, broken into 'phases' with demo-worthy results after each phase.
1. Scripts designed to automate as much of the Raspberry Pi setup as possible while being much more transparent than ready-to-download images.

An infinite number of tweaks and variations on this ambient lighting setup are possible.
Wherever reasonable, Stagelight Manifesto docs will NOT go into these variations in order to provide a focused and easy
to follow guide. Of course, you should feel free to diverge from these docs wherever you want to make your setup your own.
